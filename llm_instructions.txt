Make a single index.html file that includes Javascript and CSS inline that can be used to chat with the Claude LLM.  Support having multiple chats.  Use the javascript fetch API to directly interact with the anthropic http API.  Store the states of the chats using local storage.  Also include support for defining custom system promps and going back and editing and deleting past messages.

No, please use the claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 model

It seems that the anthropic api is being used incorrectly. There should be a top level system parameter not a system input message

Can you add an edit and delete button to the user messages and to the assistant messages

for the edit button, can you make the edit action happen in place using a textbox and then have a save button rather than using a javascript prompt

can you add a feature to delete, archive and reorder the chats

Sometimes claude will respond to messages with markdown, what options are there to render this markdown into nice html? (This includes code formatting)

Can we create a settings option menu and then put the system prompt in that menu instead of having it at the top of the chat. Also can we have an option in the settings menu to create a message from the agent or user directly (rather than prompting the api) so that a chat can be "imported" by copying and pasting each message.

NOTE: I have refactored the code myself to move the javascript and css into seperate files as the program was starting to get long.

There is an issue where the settings button is hidden after the first chat message is created
